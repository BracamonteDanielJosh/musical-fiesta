# Burger Order Smart Contract

## Description
The Burger Order Smart Contract is a Solidity smart contract designed to facilitate burger orders on the blockchain. It allows users to place orders by specifying their burger selection and making a payment in ether. Each order is recorded on the blockchain and can be marked as delivered when completed.

## Getting Started

### Installing
To use the smart contract, you need a compatible Ethereum development environment. You can download or clone the contract file and deploy it using tools like Remix or Truffle.

### Executing program
1. Deploy the SmartContract.sol file on your Ethereum development environment.
2. Interact with the contract using a wallet or an Ethereum development tool.
3. Call the `placeOrder` function with the desired burger selection and a payment of at least 1 ether to place an order.
4. Call the `delivered` function with the order number to mark an order as delivered.

## Help
If you encounter any issues, ensure that your Ethereum environment is properly configured and that you're interacting with the contract using the correct function parameters.
